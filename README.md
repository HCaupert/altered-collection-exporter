## Getting Started

This application is a simple collection exporter for altered, made with love by individuals, and is affiliated to Altered.

It allows to create a csv export of your collection.
It uses your authentication from the official website, but does not store anything. It actually all happens right in your browser. The website does not even have a server, everything is static.

## Developing

```bash
pnpm dev
```
